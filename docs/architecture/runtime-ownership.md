There is no supported alternate runtime, planner backend selector, Python
fallback, or secondary product executable. The retained Python packages have no
entrypoint and do not participate in product verification.

The additive `phase0_end_user_runtime` protocol extension is negotiated
explicitly. It exposes product catalog inventory, reviewed-plan digests,
target-bound real and simulated execution, retained snapshots, ordered events,
and cooperative cancellation without adding product behavior to the editor
frontend. Filesystem roots are sidecar startup policy, not `startExecution`
payload fields. Execution retry creates a new attempt; rollback and device-state
undo are not runtime capabilities.
